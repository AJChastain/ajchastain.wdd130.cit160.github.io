  <p>Although life can be frightening and dark at times, there is always beauty to be found for those who seek it. Tiny
    blossoms of light can shine quite brightly during dark times.</p>

  <ul>
    <li>a fresh breeze</li>
    <li>a brilliant sunset</li>
    <li>a few moments of peace</li>
  </ul>

  <p>Small things can make a big difference.</p>
