                <h2>Historic Details</h2>
                <p>Located along the San Fransisco Bay, the Oakland, California Temple was announced on 23 January 1961
                    and its groundbreaking followed on 26 May 1962. When it was originally dedicated on 17 November
                    1964, it was the 13th temple of The Church and the second in California. (Los Angeles was the first
                    temple in California.) <br>
                    <br>Early members of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints sailed to San Francisco, which
                    was then known as Yerba Buena, from New York City on the Ship Brooklyn, arriving in July 1846. There
                    were 238 men, women, and children, and they soon established the first school, library, bank, and
                    newspaper in California. In 1847 and again in 1924, prophets of The Church foresaw a temple in the
                    East Bay Hills. In 1942, President David O. McKay visited the site where the Oakland Temple now sits
                    and authorized the purchase of the land. <br>
                    <br>On 16 June 2019, the Oakland Temple was rededicated after extensive renovations. For photos
                    taken between these renovations and the rededication, see <a

                        news page on churchofjesuschrist.org </a>.<br> <br>The Oakland Temple has beautiful grounds
                    where
                    visitors can wander and offers a stunning view of the Bay Area. For more information and history,
